#Attack On Titan Blogging System

At first, I didn’t know where to start. This is not a perfect template because it doesn’t have many features or design elements. I am just testing and trying not to forget my learning goals, so I created it with references from other websites. I wanted to use PHP and practice ideas I had, so I think this is my first step toward reaching my goals. I learned from my tutor and also from studying his concepts. I added products, categories, characters, character details, blogs, blog details, and users. I wish I could add more features and design elements, but I couldn’t yet. I will continue improving and building new projects in the future.

If I made any mistakes or errors, that’s my fault. I’m still learning and growing as I work to understand my code. Thank you for your patience, and have a nice day!
